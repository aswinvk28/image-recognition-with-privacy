# Image Recognition with Privacy

- eBPF Observability Platform
- VEXF Packet and Frame
- HTTP over VEXF with ETags

We introduce a computer networking protocol that introduces more privacy within Cloud, Edge and other telecommunication technology involving Sensors and even for detecting interferences

We have generated a text dataset that involves text recognition for english characters consisting of buckets starting with A - Z letters. 

## Model(s) Used

The model we present are: CNN-LSTM model (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network Model) and the PaddleOCR Model which outperforms the CNN-LSTM model.

We also present a RoboFlow based Number Plate Recognition Model to demonstrate Private & Secure Data Exchange of Number Plates. 

We have developed a Construction Dataset involving: Piling Rigs, Load Carrying Cranes, Cranes, Machinery such as Excavators and other objects like Buildings, Soil. We also detect Person / People, Person with Pre-Protective Equipment (PPE). 

## Delivery of Project

We present a Mobile App that can store Scanned Copies of Sensitive Information with a prototype at:

## Other Technology Used

We have used Numpy, MNIST for recognizing Digits from a Scikit-Learn package. All can be used within an Intel Optimized Libraries and oneAPI Data Analytics System.
